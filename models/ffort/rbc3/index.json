		"text": "The Radio Block Center (RBC) is the most important subsystem of The European Railway Traffic Management System / European Train Control System, because it is responsible for guaranteeing a safe outdistancing between trains by  managing the  information received from the  onboardsubsystem (by  means of a GSM-R network) and from the Interlocking (IXL) subsystem (by means of a dedicated Wide Area Network, WAN) in order to compute and send to the trains their movement authorities, which represent the distance the trains are allowed to cover in safe conditions."
