		"text": "The Radio Block Centre (RBC) is the most important subsystem of The European Railway Traffic Management System / European Train Control System. It is responsible for guaranteeing a safe outdistancing between trains, by managing the information received from the onboard subsystem (by means of a GSM-R network) and from the interlocking subsystem (by means of a dedicated Wide Area Network). Using these subsystems, the RBC computes and sends to the trains their movement authorities, which represent the distance the trains are allowed to cover in safe conditions."
